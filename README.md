# Zharko - a simple ray tracer written in Rust

Hello! This is a simple ray tracer written in Rust for my mathematical modelling course. It is not meant to be
a serious project, I just took the opportunity to combine my course work and my Rust learning journey.

## How to run examples

The individual examples are contained in the `examples/` directory. They can be run with `cargo` like so:

```bash
cargo run --example <example>
```
